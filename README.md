My personal cloudformation, python and bash projects.

1. siem-udp.yaml:

2. automated_report.py:
Automated integrity monitoring and log inspection reports through python.Integrity Monitoring and Log Inspection are features available in Deep Security. They monitor changes and logs within your Server/Workstation that indicate a compromise.
