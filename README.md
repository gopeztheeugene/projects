# projects
My personal cloudformation, python and bash projects.

1. Deploy and create an EC2 instance hosted in RHEL using Cloud Formation. It hosts logs and detections from a security solution called Cloud One. This instance can be used as a log forwarder to an SIEM.

2. Automated integrity monitoring and log inspection reports through python.
